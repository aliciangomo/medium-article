        <p>Last week I took part in an agile development workshop. During the session we participated in a dojo-style exercise where we built a series of prototypes with LEGO following the scrum method of #agilesoftwaredevelopment.
        The objective was to experience #scrum methodology first hand through taking active part in a series of scrums.
        We stood up a team with a Product Owner, a Scrum Master and engineers (i.e. Scrum   Development Team). We followed the values and principles of agile ways of working and went through the various ceremonies i.e. sprint planning, backlog refinement, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectivesâ€¦
        After a series of sprints, we had built to the Product Ownerâ€™s specifications, a stationary holder on wheels ðŸ˜Š
        I found the experience a simple yet very effective way of helping people understand the differences between #agile and #waterfall methodologies.

        <h2>Agile is a mindset.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It is no longer just about software development, it is a way of working, a series of principles and values that drive the organisationâ€™s behaviours</li>
          <li>It is a cultural shift and for an organisation to become agile at scale the agile ways of working, values and principles need to be embedded across all levels</li>
          <li>It is shift towards collaboration, pragmatism, flexibility, empowerment and self-managementâ€¦ a move from process to outcomesâ€¦ a focus on early value and incremental benefit to adapt to emerging business realities</li>
          <li>It is not the answer to everything </li>
          <li>It is a journey that for big organisations will take a few years</li>
          <li>And thatâ€™s why it requires a strong push from the top</li>
          <li>Moving to agile requires strong and skilled agents of change as well as a clear vision</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What did it feel like? What was different?</h2>
        <p>It felt a lot more real, faster paced and collaborative than other approaches. And it created a strong sense of ownership and responsibility on the team.
        The speed, seeing something forming and useful, testable after each sprint, the sense of ownership, loss of the fear of failure</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Speed of value creation. The use of iterations and a flexible approach, allows for value to be realised incrementally </li>
          <li>This in turn generates a strong level of engagement and motivation, feeling of ownership</li>
          <li>Self-organising</li>
          <li>Definition of output and quality, constant feedback and corrections</li>
          <li>Collaboration</li>
          <li>Learning from experience</li>
          <li>Iterations allow to fail fast and supports self-organisation</li>
        </ul>
